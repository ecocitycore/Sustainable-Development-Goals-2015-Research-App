Our estimates of the number of people living with HIV are 18.7% smaller than UNAIDSâ€™s estimates in 2012. The number of people living with malaria is larger than estimated by WHO. The number of people living with HIV, tuberculosis, or malaria have all decreased since 2000. At the global level, upward trends for malaria and HIV deaths have been reversed, and declines in tuberculosis deaths have accelerated. 101 countries (74 of which are developing) still have increasing HIV incidence. Substantial progress since the Millennium Declaration is an encouraging sign of the effect of global action. -2013 <a href="http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/global-regional-and-national-incidence-and-mortality-hiv-tuberculosis-and-malaria">source</a>, <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2814%2960844-8/abstract">full text</a>
